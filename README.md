# FoundryVTT v13
With FoundryVTT v13 STA system released v2.0.0, which is a complete rewrite of the system from the ground up. With that much of the styling from this module was included, at this point I don't see any purpose for continuing this module, the last version of STA it will work with will be v1.3.1 with FOundryVTT v12.

# Improved LCARS UI for Star Trek Adventures
This is a module for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop roleplaying platform. It provides an improved LCARS interface for using the "Star Trek Adventures" game system by Modiphius.

It is based and dependent on the awesome https://github.com/mkscho63/sta "Star Trek Adventures (Unofficial)" game system for Foundry VTT by Mike Schoen.

This repository is a derivation of the LCARS UI found at https://github.com/FabulistVtt/sta-lcars-ui updated to work with Foundry V12 and with the latest Star Trek Advenures system, supporting 2e.

This module re-imagines the UI with a bluish LCARS theme inspired by "Star Trek Online" and "Star Trek: Picard". It covers more of the Foundry UI, is easier on the eyes, and even adds some usability improvements.
