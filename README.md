# Improved LCARS UI for Star Trek Adventures
This is a module for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop roleplaying platform. It provides an improved LCARS interface for using the "Star Trek Adventures" game system by Modiphius.

It is based and dependent on the awesome https://github.com/mkscho63/sta "Star Trek Adventures (Unofficial)" game system for Foundry VTT by Mike Schoen.

This repository is a derivation of the LCARS UI found at https://github.com/FabulistVtt/sta-lcars-ui updated to work with Foundry V12 and with the latest Star Trek Advenures system, supporting 2e.

This module re-imagines the UI with a bluish LCARS theme inspired by "Star Trek Online" and "Star Trek: Picard". It covers more of the Foundry UI, is easier on the eyes, and even adds some usability improvements.
